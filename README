Final:
This program allows a user to simulate a chess game. Pieces can be moved from tile to tile and if they are taken, they are removed
from the board an aligned along the side. The scene can be viewed from any custom angle and has four different texture/ color
variants that can be used. I was trying to get the pieces to move in a parabolic motion between moves or off the board if they
were taken but I was unable to get that work properly. I left that code in and just commented it out so you can see what I was 
working on.
